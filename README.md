# Music Band - HTML & CSS Project

---

*For this first milestone project:*

I decided to continue with the suggested theme of a music band and have chosen the band "Queens of the Stone Age".

I decided early on how I wanted my project to look, which technologies I was going to use and what should be included in a website of this category type. I have created this project with no JavaScript or other libraries, which while proving a challange at times, enabled me to think outside the box when implementing certain features and showcases my understanding of the relationships between elements. 

Ultimately, my overall goal was to create a functional, modern and user friendly site, which loads quickly, is responsive on devices on all sizes and provides a good user experience which is both easy to navigate and informative.

 
 
## UX

### Who this site is for and how it can help them

This site is intended for fans of the band. It's theme is based on aspect of promoting the bands tour and new album release.

When deciding upon a ux layout I wanted to put myself in the position of the end-user and ask the essential questions such as:

- *Why* am I going to this website and what reason would I have to go there?
- *What* information should I expect to find?
- *When* I first load the website, how likely am I to stay, does the inital first paint grab my attention?
- *Can* I get to where I want to go easily and at a glance figure out how to get there?
- *Does* the website contain common features I'd expect to find on any other music bands website?
- *Did* the website fulfill my expections and needs?

To answer these questions I first browsed a number of high profile music band websites to look for common patterns and features and how they applied to different screen sizes. I also browsed on aawards to get an understanding of the kind of layouts that were common in a music category. I also had to take into consideration that not using any JavaScipt would affect how content could be presented and find solutions to issues such as mobile navigation.  

I decided on the number of pages and amount of content I would have, created basic wireframe ideas and set upon creating an empty project skeleton to build on. When deciding on the content type, I set myself the below user stories as a base line to work from.

#### User Stories:
- As a user, I can immediately understand who the website is about and it's purpose.
- As a user, I can easily understand the navigation and layout structure to find my way around the website.
- As a user, I expect the website to load quickly, while still remaining modern.
- As a user, I can expect to find the information most associated with a music bands website.
- As a user, I can see the bands latest news and find links to follow them on their social media.
- As a user, I can find links to buy their music and merchandise, see tour dates and subscribe to a fan newsletter.
- As a user, I can see images and videos relating to the band.
- As a user, I can hear a preview of the bands music.

## Technologies Used

---

I choose not to use bootstrap and instead focus on custom pure css, css grid and flexbox. The reasons being that:

- I wanted to set my own breakpoints as to when the content needed it, not based on common screen sizes.
- Bootstrap applies many default styles which I would need to override.
- I wanted to showcase my ability and understanding of css and the box model, grid system, media queries and relationship between elements.
- CSS Grid and flexbox adequately suited my needs with minimal code
- I could create my own classes and rules to be used amongst multiple components/elements. 

### Color Scheme

The sites color scheme takes inspiration from the bands new album logo which comprises and blue, black and white. I wanted to implement these colors site wide in a minimal fashion. These colors would be applied to buttons, backgrounds and fonts.

### Navigation

The navigation proved to tricky. I revisited this feature a number of times to edit and make adjustments.
